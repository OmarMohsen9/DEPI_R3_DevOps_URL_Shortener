## Project Overview
This project implements best practices of modern DevOps, focusing on building a containerized URL shortener webservice and establishing a complete observability stack around it using Prometheus and Grafana. The entire system is orchestrated locally with Docker Compose, leveraging development, containerization, monitoring, and alerting skills.
## Project Objectives
* Develop a functional, simple URL shortener web application with REST API endpoints.
* Containerize the application and its dependencies using Docker for consistent environments.
* Implement Monitoring by instrumenting the application code to expose custom Prometheus metrics.
* Visualize Data by building a comprehensive Grafana dashboard to monitor service health and usage patterns in real-time.
* Ensure Resilience by adding data persistence with Docker volumes and configuring meaningful alerts for operational awareness.
